## 🧠 Task 01: First ANN From Scratch
In this task, I experienced training an ANN from scratch.

- **Dataset:** [Loan Prediction](datasets/Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling.xlsx)


## 💵 Task 02: Loan Prediction ANN
Here, I trained different ANNs using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to understand their performances.

- **Dataset:** [Loan Prediction](datasets/Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling.xlsx)

## 📊 Task 03: Advertising Classification and House Prices Prediction
I trained a Random Forest Classifier on Advertising data, and a Linear Regression  model on Airbnb data

- **Datasets:** [Advertising](datasets/advertising.csv)
[Airbnb](datasets/listings_berlin.csv)

## ❤️🚗 Task 04: Heart Failure Classification and Car Price Prediction
I used TensorFlow to train 2 sequential ANN models on car price and heart failure data.

- **Dataset:** [Heart Failure](datasets/heart.csv)
[Car Price](datasets/CarPrice_Assignment.csv)

## 💸 Task 05: Heart Bank Note Authentication
I created a comprehensive EDA and ML/DL prediction notebook for the Bank Note Authentication dataset.
The notebook includes:
Classification using SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network.
Clustering using K-Means and another suitable clustering algorithm.
I compared the algorithms to identify the best ones for classification and clustering tasks.
- **Dataset:** [Bank Note Authentication](datasets/BankNote_Authentication.csv)

## 🖼️ Task 06: Heart Bank Note Authentication
I chose five major image processing filters: Gaussian Blur Filter, Median Filter, Laplacian Filter, Bilateral Filter, and Gabor Filter, and implemented them once from scratch and using OpenCV.

- **Test Image:** [original_image.PNG](datasets/original_image.PNG)
